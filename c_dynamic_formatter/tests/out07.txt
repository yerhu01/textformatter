          When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much

          struck with certain facts in the distribution of the

          inhabitants of South America, and in the geological

          relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that

          continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on

          the origin of species -- that mystery of mysteries, as it

          has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my

          return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something

          might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently

          accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which

          could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years'

          work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew

          up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch

          of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from

          that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the

          same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on

          these personal details, as I give them to show that I have

          not been hasty in coming to a decision.



          My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two

          or three more years to complete it, and as my health is far

          from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I

          have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr.

          Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the

          Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same

          general conclusions that I have on the origin of species.

          Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a

          request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who

          sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the

          third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell

          and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work -- the latter

          having read my sketch of 1844 -- honoured me by thinking it

          advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir,

          some brief extracts from my manuscripts.
